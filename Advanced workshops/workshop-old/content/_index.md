# AWS DeepRacer Workshops


Dive under the hood of AWS DeepRacer

Introduction

AWS DeepRacer is a 1/18th scale autonomous race car designed to get developers hands-on with reinforcement learning (RL). AWS DeepRacer leverages AWS RoboMaker to create a simulation environment in which our reinforcement learning agent (i.e. our autonomous car) can learn how to drive autonomously. The learning part, or training, is facilitated using Amazon SageMaker.

The AWS DeepRacer console is optimized to provide a user-friendly introduction to reinforcement learning to developers new to machine learning. This series of workshops is intended to provide developers with an deep dive on how they can use an Amazon SageMaker notebook Instance to achieve the following in their AWS DeepRacer models:

Augment the simulation environment
Manipulate inputs to the neural network
Modify neural network architecture
Run distributed rollouts
Debug your model
